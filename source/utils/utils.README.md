# What is utils

Utils in this project is the directory that contains programs that help the programmer, as im writing these are the examples i can cite:

- manyprint - Manyprint is just a function that takes in multiple strings, adds "\n" to the them and prints them out, i created it with the intent of stopping the linter from complaining about string concatenation and the formatter making it harder to read, plus not having to make one print after another.

- fira_code_loading_bar - old project of mine, its a loading bar using the dedicated symbols from fira code, initially used in the icmp scan to show how much of a success it was (in case you didn't want to bother reading).
