# Overview

This project provides a module for creating loading bars and spinners using [fira code's](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) special loading glyphs.

## Loading bar

This project provides a function to generate loading bars:

```python
generate_loading_bar(
    current_value = 50, # How much progress
    total_value = 100,  # Of how much
    bar_length = 100    # Optional, default is 100
    )
```

This code will generate you a nice loading bar:

For best results enable font ligatures

### Usage

In case you are less experienced this is how you can make it update instead of printing a new line, this is an example for it in use

```python
for i in range(1, 100000):

    print(f'\r{generate_loading_bar(i, 100000, 100)}', end='')

```
the \r is called a return carriage, it returns the "printing cursor" back to the start of the line, in case you don't get the name it's in reference to typewriters

in the end of a print the default is for python to add a newline (\n) at the end of a line, by overwriting that default and using the return carriage we can make the command line write a line, erase it and write again in the same line


## Loading spinner

This project also provides a loading spinner so your loading bar doesnt get lonely.

For this one you don't really need to have ligatures on, but then why even use Fira Code?

### Usage

The usage here is basically to give your iterator and how many iterations for the spinner to step into the next "frame"

``` python
for i in range(0, 100000):
    print(f'\r{generate_spinner(i, 2000)}', end='')
print("\rsuccess!")  # return carriage again to erase the spinner
```
